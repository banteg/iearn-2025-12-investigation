DeFi protocols are vulnerable to price oracle failures including oracle manipulation and incorrectly reported prices. If only one oracle is used, this creates a single point of failure and opens a vector for attacking the protocol. The Resilient Oracle uses multiple sources and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate prices and protect the protocol from oracle attacks. For every market (vToken) we configure the main, pivot and fallback oracles. The oracles are configured per vToken's underlying asset address. The main oracle oracle is the most trustworthy price source, the pivot oracle is used as a loose sanity checker and the fallback oracle is used as a backup price source. To validate prices returned from two oracles, we use an upper and lower bound ratio that is set for every market. The upper bound ratio represents the deviation between reported price (the price that’s being validated) and the anchor price (the price we are validating against) above which the reported price will be invalidated. The lower bound ratio presents the deviation between reported price and anchor price below which the reported price will be invalidated. So for oracle price to be considered valid the below statement should be true: ``` anchorRatio = anchorPrice/reporterPrice isValid = anchorRatio <= upperBoundAnchorRatio && anchorRatio >= lowerBoundAnchorRatio ``` In most cases, Chainlink is used as the main oracle, other oracles are used as the pivot oracle depending on which supports the given market and Binance oracle is used as the fallback oracle. For a fetched price to be valid it must be positive and not stagnant. If the price is invalid then we consider the oracle to be stagnant and treat it like it's disabled.","version":1}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"contracts/ResilientOracle.sol":"ResilientOracle"},"evmVersion":"cancun","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs","useLiteralContent":true},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/Ownable2StepUpgradeable.sol":{"content":"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.9.0) (access/Ownable2Step.sol)\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"./OwnableUpgradeable.sol\";\nimport {Initializable} from \"../proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\";\n\n/**\n * @dev Contract module which provides access control mechanism, where\n * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to\n * specific functions.\n *\n * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract.

protocols are vulnerable to price oracle failures including oracle manipulation and incorrectly\n * reported prices. If only one oracle is used, this creates a single point of failure and opens a vector\n * for attacking the protocol.\n *\n * The Resilient Oracle uses multiple sources and fallback mechanisms to provide accurate prices and protect\n * the protocol from oracle attacks.\n *\n * For every market (vToken) we configure the main, pivot and fallback oracles. The oracles are configured per\n * vToken's underlying asset address. The main oracle oracle is the most trustworthy price source, the pivot\n * oracle is used as a loose sanity checker and the fallback oracle is used as a backup price source.\n *\n * To validate prices returned from two oracles, we use an upper and lower bound ratio that is set for every\n * market. The upper bound ratio represents the deviation between reported price (the price that’s being\n * validated) and the anchor price (the price we are validating against) above which the reported price will\n * be invalidated. The lower bound ratio presents the deviation between reported price and anchor price below\n * which the reported price will be invalidated. So for oracle price to be considered valid the below statement\n * should be true:\n\n```\nanchorRatio = anchorPrice/reporterPrice\nisValid = anchorRatio <= upperBoundAnchorRatio && anchorRatio >= lowerBoundAnchorRatio\n```\n\n * In most cases, Chainlink is used as the main oracle, other oracles are used as the pivot oracle depending\n * on which supports the given market and Binance oracle is used as the fallback oracle.\n *\n * For a fetched price to be valid it must be positive and not stagnant. If the price is invalid then we consider the\n * oracle to be stagnant and treat it like it's disabled.\n */\ncontract ResilientOracle is PausableUpgradeable, AccessControlledV8, ResilientOracleInterface {\n    /**\n     * @dev Oracle roles:\n     * **main**: The most trustworthy price source\n     * **pivot**: Price oracle used as a loose sanity checker\n     * **fallback**: The backup source when main oracle price is invalidated\n     */\n    enum OracleRole {\n        MAIN,\n        PIVOT,\n        FALLBACK\n    }\n\n    struct TokenConfig {\n        /// @notice asset address\n        address asset;\n        /// @notice `oracles` stores the oracles based on their role in the following order:\n        /// [main, pivot, fallback],\n        /// It can be indexed with the corresponding enum OracleRole value\n        address[3] oracles;\n        /// @notice `enableFlagsForOracles` stores the enabled state\n        /// for each oracle in the same order as `oracles`\n        bool[3] enableFlagsForOracles;\n        /// @notice `cachingEnabled` is a flag that indicates whether the asset price should be cached\n        bool cachingEnabled;\n    }\n\n    uint256 public constant INVALID_PRICE = 0;\n\n    /// @notice Native market address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    address public immutable nativeMarket;\n\n    /// @notice VAI address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    address public immutable vai;\n\n    /// @notice Set this as asset address for Native token on each chain.This is the underlying for vBNB (on bsc)\n    /// and can serve as any underlying asset of a market that supports native tokens\n    address public constant NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDR = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;\n\n    /// @notice Slot to cache the asset's price, used for transient storage\n    /// custom:storage-location erc7201:venus-protocol/oracle/ResilientOracle/cache\n    /// keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256(\"venus-protocol/oracle/ResilientOracle/cache\")) - 1))\n    ///   & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))\n    bytes32 public constant CACHE_SLOT = 0x4e99ec55972332f5e0ef9c6623192c0401b609161bffae64d9ccdd7ad6cc7800;\n\n    /// @notice Bound validator contract address\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow state-variable-immutable\n    BoundValidatorInterface public immutable boundValidator;\n\n    mapping(address => TokenConfig) private tokenConfigs;\n\n    event TokenConfigAdded(\n        address indexed asset,\n        address indexed mainOracle,\n        address indexed pivotOracle,\n        address fallbackOracle\n    );\n\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is set\n    event OracleSet(address indexed asset, address indexed oracle, uint256 indexed role);\n\n    /// Event emitted when an oracle is enabled or disabled\n    event OracleEnabled(address indexed asset, uint256 indexed role, bool indexed enable);\n\n    /// Event emitted when an asset cachingEnabled flag is set\n    event CachedEnabled(address indexed asset, bool indexed enabled);\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Checks whether an address is null or not\n     */\n    modifier notNullAddress(address someone) {\n        if (someone == address(0)) revert(\"can't be zero address\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Checks whether token config exists by checking whether asset is null address\n     * @dev address can't be null, so it's suitable to be used to check the validity of the config\n     * @param asset asset address\n     */\n    modifier checkTokenConfigExistence(address asset) {\n        if (tokenConfigs[asset].asset == address(0)) revert(\"token config must exist\");\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @notice Constructor for the implementation contract.
